# My dotfiles (and some helpful scripts)

A simple dotfile managment system written in bash is located at `<repo>/dfsetup.sh`, the dotfiles are stored in `<repo>/dotfiles/`, and extra scripts are stored in `<repo>/bin/`.

To set everything up, clone the repo, and then run:
```bash
chmod +x dfsetup.sh
./dfsetup.sh
```
